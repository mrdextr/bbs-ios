## BBS App Development Workshop

The folder [Todo](https://github.com/mrdextr/bbs-ios/tree/master/Todo) contains the XCode project we will work with. Lines of codes were removed and from watching the simulator result we try to get it running again. Differences can be seen before in the presentation video. Try to remember stuff or look in detail on the simulator results from this project.

The [install](https://github.com/mrdextr/bbs-ios/blob/master/install.sh)-file can be executed on command line. First do a `cd path/to/folder` and then `./install.sh`. It will execute the contained lines automatically.

We are also using CocoaPods. CocoaPods dependency is installed with executing the install.sh-file. Again with `cd path/to/project/folder` in terminal you get into the project folder. Execute `pods install` so the XCode project won't result in errors. After the installation of CocoaPods only use the .xcworkspace-file to open the project so dependencies are loaded correctly.

Have a fun workshop!
